\begin{abstract} % abstract
\parttitle{Background} 
The demographic time identity consists in a linear relationship between all pairs of six fundamental time measures: age, period, cohort, time to death, length of life, and time of death. Certain subsets of time measures in this and other higher order identities consist in measures that are independent of one another.
\parttitle{Objective} 
We aim to describe the relationship between independent time measures and the identities within which they are nested, with special attention to the demographic time identity and its three independent time dyads. We also aim to determine whether data structured on such time dyads might be useful in demographic research.
\parttitle{Data and Methods} 
We illustrate concepts visually based on prevalence data estimated from the US Health and Retirement study.
\parttitle{Results} 
We show that a Cartesian mapping of independent time dyads forms a redundant mapping of the demographic timespace. These add three novel demographic perspectives to four previously described Lexis-like perspectives, for a total of seven proposed standard perspectives. 
\parttitle{Conclusions} 
We show independent sets of time measures to be consistent with the temporal identities within which they are nested. We demonstrate that these perspectives can be useful for pattern detection and characterization in demographic research.

\section*{Background}

Dated events on a timeline form the foundation of numerous empirical approaches to detect, estimate, and describe patterns in processes and outcomes in the social sciences. Processes may be continuous/discrete, conditional/unconditional, forward/backward \citep{brouard2019backward}, or others. Outcomes may be prevalence, expectancies and variances, sequences, episode statistics, and others. Outcomes can be calculated from a process model or directly from data. Examples of process patterns include age-structured rates of fertility, mortality, and migration. Examples of outcome patterns include trends in length of life, healthy life expectancy, counts of births structured in some way, or employment trajectories. 

This paper deals with the calendar relationships that underpin all such knowledge of the world. Most empirical work that describes processes and outcomes makes use of a limited subset of the temporal structure that is available, and often the implications of relationships between time measures are unrecognized. Previous work \citep{riffe2017demographictime} formalizes the relationship between events in time, and the durations between events. A set of events determines a further set of durations. A set of events and their implied durations comprise a relationship that we call a temporal \emph{identity}. The most common of these in empirical demographic research is the \emph{Lexis} identity between period (date), birth cohort (date), and age (duration): $C + A = P$. Many other Lexis-like relationships between linearly dependent time measures can be combined into higher-order Lexis identities. 

A primary example of a higher-order Lexis identity is the so-called \emph{demographic time identity}, which defines relationships among age (A), period (P), cohort (C), time until death (T), time of death (D), and length of life (L). In describing the demographic time identity, \citet{riffe2017demographictime} give an almost exhaustive account of the so-called \emph{informative} and \emph{uninformative} dyads. Informative dyads are those sets of two time measures (from APCTDL) that imply a third time measure via identity. For example, AP implies C. Four such 3-part (triad) identities are described at length, with examples and diagram depiction (APC, TPD, CPD, TAL). Uninformative dyads are sets of two time measures that do not directly relate, and which therefore do not imply a third time measure. The three examples given are LP, AD, and CT, which are depicted in the authors' Tab.~(2) and discussed in the text as follows:
\begin{quote}
Triad identities are more meaningful than uninformative dyads. This is so even in the absence of data, due to the underlying relationship between measures. Each of the triad identities can accommodate some version of a lifeline, for instance \citep[p5][]{riffe2017demographictime}. 
\end{quote}

Contrary to the above, in the present note we aim to show how uninformative dyads can reveal meaningful relationships in data. For better semantics and precision, we suggest calling these \emph{independent} dyads rather than uninformative dyads. We relate independent dyad diagrams to lifelines in two dimensions (2d). We relate 2d independent planes to the three-dimensional (3d) demographic time identity, showing how these are also cross-sections of the same 3d volume, but which follow a cubic rather than a tetrahedral structure. We show how data structured on independent time measures may still reveal meaningful patterns using historical data from Qu\'{e}bec. We speculate on a way to view and interpret data structured by the demographic time identity using arbitrarily defined planes as cross-sections. We speculate on how data structured by independent time measures may be meaningful in general.

\section*{Geometric relationships}

  The demographic time identity can be represented as a tetrahedral graph, with time measures mapped to the six edges of a tetrahedron. The four Lexis-like identities are found on the faces of the tetrahedron. The identity fills a 3d space because tetrahedra tessellate with octahedra in a 2:1 ratio. \citet{riffe2017demographictime} considered neither independent pairs of time measures nor the significance of octahedra in this geometric construct. Figure~\ref{fig:tet} shows the tetrahedral graph of the demographic time identity among age (A), period (P), cohort (C), time to death (T), death cohort (D), and length of life (L). Independent dyads are those that do not share any vertex in the graph, and these appear as disjoint and perpendicular in the present 2d graph representation, though they are not perpendicular in 3d space: CT, LP, and AD.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Tetrahedral graph of demographic time hexad identity, with edges
labelled by the six time indices. Reproduced from 
\citet{riffe2017demographictime}.}
\label{fig:tet}
\end{figure}

 In a triad identity there are no independent dyads, but in the demographic time identity there are three independent dyads, each consisting in an event paired with a duration defined as the interval between the other two dated events. In general, a time identity defined on the basis of $n$ events implies a graph with $n+1$ vertices, implying a total of $\binom{n+1}{2}$ graph edges; see \citet{riffe2017demographictime} for multiple examples, though not formal proof. Each edge in the graph represents a time measure. Since $n$ of the edges are calendar-event measures, $\binom{n+1}{2} - n$ are duration measures. The $n$ calendar-dated measures are represented as graph edges sharing a single vertex. Triad identities are found wherever two edges share a vertex, for a total of three vertices, which means there must be $\binom{n+1}{3}$ of them within an identity. Independent dyads are pairs of edges that do not share a vertex, meaning that they use four vertices. Since there are $\binom{n+1}{2}$ ways to select one edge, there are $\binom{n-1}{2}$ ways to do so after having removed the two vertices of the first edge, or $\frac{1}{2}\binom{n+1}{2}\binom{n-1}{2}$ unique ways to select two unconnected edges, which simplifies to $3\binom{n+1}{4}$ independent dyads. For a more complicated example, a multistate model of period, birth, marriage, divorce, and death ($n=5$) would therefore imply 45 independent dyads, and a total of 20 triad identities. As $n$ increases, the fraction of possible temporal dyads that are independent approaches 1. To illustrate this point think of the universe of all dates and the potential durations between them: Pick two out of this massive urn and they will almost certainly be independent in this sense.

Any pair of quantitative variables can define the axes of a standard Cartesian plane. When Cartesian axes are defined by two independent time measures and in equal time units, the resultant plane is an isometric projection. Let's call this an independent plane for short. There are two ways that an independent plane may be treated: either (i) accounting for a larger temporal identity or (ii) not. Here we limit comments to the 3d case of the demographic time identity. For the first kind (i) planes are cross-sections of the same 3d demographic timespace previously defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:tet}, and the independent dyads can also be conceived of as \emph{axes of view} on the demographic timespace. This idea is described further in Sec.~\ref{sec:viewaxes}. For the second kind (ii), independent planes are the same as any standard Cartesian plane used in data analyses: patterns revealed could be due to real structure or due to sample heterogeneity in other time measures. That is, the larger temporal identity within which these independent measures are nested is \emph{flattened}.

\subsection*{View axes}
\label{sec:viewaxes}
 Although the demographic time identity is based on only three simple linear relationships, a perspective figure of their joint relationship may help some readers better appreciate how the triad planes and independent planes relate. Imagine the graph from Fig.~\ref{fig:tet} projected as a 3d regular tetrahedron. An angle of view directly at any of the four faces of the demographic time tetrahedron reveals the plane-perspective of a Lexis-like identity. In other words, the angle of view is set as \emph{normal} to one of the faces of the tetrahedron, and the respective plane is orthogonal to the median (axes of 3-fold symmetry) of the tetrahedron. Interactive Fig.~\ref{fig:depviewaxes} may help visualize the notion of viewing axes--- if the tetrahedron were rotated so that the dashed line were reduced to a single point, we would be looking directly at the APC (Lexis plane), and at a \emph{depth} determined by a given value of D or T or L. Independent dyad planes are revealed when the viewing angle is such that the midpoints of opposite tetrahedral edges are aligned. There are three pairs of opposite edges (LP, TC, AD), and therefore three viewing angles of this kind, which map to the bimedians of the tetrahedron (axes of 2-fold symmetry), depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:indepviewaxes} with a dashed line passing through the midpoints of L and P.

The APC plane is orthogonal to this line, shown here as a transparent red plane transecting the tetrahedron. TPD, CDL, or TAL planes would transect this space in parallel with the other faces of the tetrahedron.}

    \label{fig:indepviewaxes}       
\end{subfigure}
\caption{The seven view axes of the demographic time identity map to geometric properties of the regular tetrahedron, here drawn as a perspective plot. Triad planes are seen by gazing orthogonal to a face of the tetrahedron. The independent dyad planes are seen by rotating the tetrahedron so that a pair of opposite edges are aligned at their midpoints. }
\label{fig:viewaxes}
\end{figure}

Given a 3d volume of data structured by the demographic time identity, a cross-section orthogonal to any of the seven view axes illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:viewaxes} can delimit a Cartesian plot of. There is no reason not to do this for outcome measures, for example disease prevalence, in search of meaningful patterns. Further, when \emph{slicing} through such a complex timespace, we are agnostic about cut angles in general, but \emph{snapping} to axes defined on the basis of unit time measures leads to easier interpretation.

\subsection*{Cross-section equivalencies}
Use this section to give a formal introduction to how a single control variable and depth implies a single surface, but the abscissa and ordinate choices can vary, implying different rotations and potentially giving different insights.

This is a temporary note. I've noticed some equivalencies when taking cross-sections of the hexad timespace using the HRS data. We have four triad identities and three independent dyads. For each of these, when taking a cross-section of the 3d space, one needs to specify a control variable. For example, for APC, one could control for T, L or D. Certain combinations of abscissa, ordinate and control measure yield identical images (albeit with different axis labels due to different time measures). For example, APC, LCD, AD, and LP are all identical when controlled for T. TPD, LCD, LP, and TC are all identical when controlled for A. And in general for each of the six possible controls, there are four ways to specify a plane that will yield identically filled surfaces. By extension, we conclude that there are six *fundamental* cross sections. I deposit this text here temporarily, but this is in need of further verification, as my data filtering may need some refinement for the case of independent dyads. Specifically, for a given independent dyad we may not wish to hold one of the other four measures constant. And of course this could all be my mistake.


\section*{Data}
We illustrate concepts using RAND version 2016v1 of the United States Health and Retirement Study (HRS) \citep{HRS, RAND}. These data are used to illustrate how independent time perspectives can be used to take cross-sections of phenomena with multiple time dimensions. We use these data to estimate how the prevalence of X varies over age A, time-to-death T, and year of birth C. This is only possible for respondents that have deceased, a total of X individuals with a total of N observations. Prevalence is defined as the average value of the outcome in each combination of A, T, and C. We estimate it using logistic regression, where natural splines over A, T, and C are covariates. The procedure takes account of the sampling structure of the HRS, and further details can be found in \citet{riffe2017hle}. Since the edges A, T, C in Fig.~\ref{fig:tet} are both connected and touch all four vertices in the graph, our smoothed prevalence fills the 3d space defined by the demographic time identity. Prevalence estimates are for exact midpoints in single year intervals, such that we can define the remaining demographic time variables directly as follows: $P = C + A$; $D = P + T$; $L = A + T$. This lets us explore the space in a structured way using cross-section planes that are orthogonal to the medians and bimedians

% TR: deprecate enture Quebec section, because we only produced
% flattened surfaces, which although they contain patterns that are
%fun to interpret, half of them are due to boundary conditions
% that introduce tricky kinds of heterogeneity. We therefore
% would like to focus on controlled cross-sections of the 3d demographic
% timespace.


%\section*{Independent time surfaces of population structure}
%As a first pass to demonstrate concepts, we cross-tabulate Qu\'{e}bec's historical population structure by the three sets of independent demographic time measures. Each cross-tabulation is represented as a demographic surface using filled contour heat maps to create Lexis-like surfaces. These surfaces are distinct from Lexis surfaces in a few important ways. Lexis surfaces are drawn with diagonal lines at a slope equal to the aspect ratio between time units in $y$ and time units in $x$, usually 45$^\circ$ (APC, LCD). Other triad time surfaces might be drawn with descending diagonals (TPD, TAL). Surfaces on independent planes might have features that run horizontally, vertically or in both 45$^\circ$ and -45$^\circ$ diagonals, depending on the case, but in general it only makes sense to draw them as a standard Cartesian grid without any diagonals, although they could be drawn with diagonals running in both directions. 

%As mentioned, the three independent dyads in the demographic time identity each consist in one event measure and one duration measure. Our convention for orienting the Cartesian plane is to use the date measure as abscissa ($x$-axis) and the duration measure as ordinate ($y$-axis). Since a duration measure is the difference between two event dates, this means that independent dyads in this particular identity only arise when three event dates are known, which identifies the full demographic time identity (PCD implies TAL). Tabulations by two independent time measures can only be done in practice if each of the six demographic time measures are either observed or derivable. 

%\subsection*{LP: Lifespan and period}
%Following this standard orientation, we draw an LP diagram with period in abscissa and lifespan in the ordinate axis. This is an ageless diagram. An individual with a lifespan of 80 years is represented as a horizontal line spanning from the time of birth until the time of death. That is, for each increment in P, L is uniform within an individual. An individual lifespan, which determines the ordinate, is only known in retrospect. On a single lifeline, one can trace the progression of age (and the other time measures) from left to right.  Fig.~\ref{fig:lpd} shows an example of an LP diagram that includes some illustrative lifelines. The lifeline labelled \textbf{A} is in a lower ordinate position because it represents a shorter life, whereas the lifeline \textbf{B} represents a longer life. These example lifelines do not overlap, but for aggregate data tabulated by L and P, any given coordinate contains a mixture of ages. Heterogeneity of this kind is greater for longer lives than for shorter lives.

%\label{fig:lpd}
%\end{figure}

%Fig.~\ref{fig:lpq} displays the Qu\'{e}bec population structure on an LP surface. Higher $y$ values correspond to longer lives, and therefore more overlapped underlying lifelines. The upper regions of the surface are thus smoother with respect to time than lower regions. Growth over time in to-be-long-lived individuals could occur due to population growth or mortality improvement. We know this pattern is not due to migration because this population was mostly closed in this time. For Qu\'{e}bec, increasing contours over time are primarily due to population growth. 

%Shorter lives (lower L) reveal the rhythms of mortality, adding a peculiar relief to the surface. High-mortality years are marked with vertical cliffs in population structure: Right-aligned cliffs are found on the LP surface when many lives over a range of ages are simultaneously extinguished. These vertical rifts trace back to births over a range of years, producing the -45$\circ$ feature \includegraphics{Figures/LP_mort_tri.pdf}. Mortality shocks therefore produce raised triangle relief pattern in population structure. A single isolated year with an extremely high number of births could produce a raised left-edge, but fertility shocks of this kind are far less prominent than mortality shocks in this population. Some known epidemics are marked below the surface with red strips \citep[cf Figure 1.1][]{mazan2011}

%The inverted step pattern on the right edge of this surface betrays some of the peculiarities of data collection for this source. Death information comes from burial records, which had some age constraints in data collection, depending on the period: For years 1800 to 1825 only deaths in ages 50 and greater were collected. For years 1826 to 1850, only deaths in ages 75 and greater were collected. Exceptions to this block edge structure owe to the use of multiple potential sources for death dates. Since lifelines accrue to the LP surface only after deaths occur, the right-side region of Fig.~\ref{fig:lpq} is incomplete: further increments will happen as death data are added to the series. This incompleteness is less for shorter lives, which accrue quickly to the surface due to their brevity.

%\subsection*{TC: Time-to-death and cohort}

%The time-to-death T distribution of an extinct and closed birth cohort C (defined as a birth cohort all members of which have died) reveals its life table. Fig.~\ref{fig:tcd} shows an example of a TC diagram, where C is in abscissa and T is the ordinate variable. A lifeline on the CT plane is drawn as a vertical segment extending downward from birth until death on the bottom axis. For example, lifeline \textbf{A} represents an individual born in 1624 and dying at age 20 in 1644. In an aggregate of population exposure, this lifeline contributes 1 to the count in each time step descending from 20 to 0 --- the entire countdown timeline. Since each member of a birth cohort eventually comes to die, the coordinate $T = 0$ is maximally heterogeneous with respect to any of the other demographic time measures (A,L,P,D), and lifeline overlap decreases in higher T.

%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=.6]{Figures/TCdiagram.pdf}
%\caption{TC diagram, with example lifelines. Lifeline \textbf{A} is from the 1624 birth cohort, and starts with a birth (solid circle) with 20 remaining years of life, and ends with a death (crossed circle) on the bottom axis (year 1644). Lifeline \textbf{B} is from the 1638 birth cohort, starting with 94 remaining years of life at birth, and ending with death in 1732.}
%\label{fig:tcd}
%\end{figure}

%Fig.~\ref{fig:tcq} shows a TC tabulation of the Quebec population structure. A few features of this surface stand out. First, as a cohort ages, vertical strips are completed upwards. Ergo, the lower regions of the surface are more complete than the upper regions, and the slanted step structure on the right edge of the surface corresponds to the block-step pattern of the LP surface in Fig~\ref{fig:lpq}. Second, the relatively sparse earlier cohorts are visible as vertical strips. This pattern is due to left-censoring on the moment of migration. As the series progresses rightward the cohort experience becomes more completely described in the closed population renewal, making the series smoother. In general, we see the population grow as birth year advances. If one were to normalize cohort size to something constant then the surface would closely resemble an AC Lexis surface of survivorship.

%\subsection*{AD: Age and year of death}

%Following our convention, we draw an AD diagram with year of death D in the abscissa and age A in the ordinate. Lifelines in the AD diagram start at age 0 on the bottom axis, and rise vertically until the age at death, always within the same death cohort D. The AD diagram is therefore the reverse of the TC diagram: Fig.~\ref{fig:add} uses the same lifelines as Fig.~\ref{fig:tcd}. Thus the lifeline \textbf{A} starts at age 0 and rises until death at age 20 in 1644 (D). D is constant for an individual in this diagram. In the TC diagram the line for the same life was drawn 20 years earlier in the year of birth, and the lifeline descends rather than rises. 
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=.6]{Figures/ADdiagram.pdf}
%\caption{AD diagram, with example lifelines (same as in previous diagrams). Lifeline \textbf{A} is destined to die in 1644, starting with a birth (solid circle) at age 0, and ending with a death (crossed circle) on at age 20. Lifeline \textbf{B} is destined to die in 1732, starting at age 0 and rising to a death at age 94 in 1732.}
%\label{fig:add}
%\end{figure}

%In a population aggregate, exposure accrues as in the other diagram settings: lifelines contribute 1 year to exposure in each year over the lifecourse. There is no direct way to infer a life table from an AD population structure unless the population happens to be in stationary renewal \citep{villavicencio2016symmetries}, and in this narrow case the TC surface would appear identical to the AD surface. Fig.~\ref{fig:adq} shows an AD tabulation of the same Qu\'{e}bec data. Whereas vertical striation in the TC tabulation of Fig.~\ref{fig:tcq} was primarily due to birth cohort size, in Fig.~\ref{fig:adq} vertical striation results from mortality shocks. Dark vertical lines in this surface correspond to the right edge of the \emph{mortality triangles} of the LP surface. Light vertical strips might be due to stochasticity and sparseness in early years, to under-coverage or under-registration of deaths in particular years, or to selection following large mortality shocks \citep{luy2019life}. The surface has a hard right edge because the source data collection ceases around 1850, but recall from the LP surface that different age ranges were collected until different final years. Since deaths for the years 1826 to 1850 were only collected for ages 75+, the AD surface is flat in ages 0 to 74 for these same years. Likewise the preceding quarter century will be flat for age 0 to 49. [[[Tim, what accounts for the vertical darker strips in these time intervals?]]] The AD surface of Fig.~\ref{fig:adq} is therefore incomplete in the area corresponding to the white space below the stepped right edge of Fig.~\ref{fig:lpq}.

%\section*{Independent time surfaces as cross-sections}
%Here use example of HRS prevalence surfaces produced at novel \emph{cut} angles. I'm thinking maybe small multiples, since each would be a fly-through of cross sections in fixed intervals. There would be 3 independent fly-throughs, and 4 Lexis-like fly throughs. These would be  like Fig.~(7) of \cite{riffe2017demographictime}, which is a fly-though at the TAL viewing angle. So, maybe each fly-through is a column and each perspective is a row? Maybe 10-year jumps in columns to imply 3-4 columns? Total? For example, each TAL slice in that Fig 7 is held for a fixed C. It would have been possible to hold P or D fixed instead, but I guess the actually slices would be identical, just the labels would change. Just need to be clear about it when labelling said panel figure.
