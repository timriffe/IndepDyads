\section*{Interactive 3d diagrams}

This excerpt repeats Fig.~2 from the main manuscript, replacing the 2d renderings with 3d interactive diagrams. Spending some time rotating the diagrams may add intuition to the View Axes section, here repeated in full.

\subsection*{View axes}
\label{sec:viewaxes}
Imagine now the 3d projection of the graph from Fig.~\ref{fig:tet}, a regular tetrahedron. An angle of view directly at any of the four faces of the demographic time tetrahedron reveals the plane-perspective of a Lexis-like identity. In other words, the viewing axis is set as \emph{normal} to one of the faces of the tetrahedron. Interactive Fig.~\ref{fig:viewaxes} may help visualize the notion of viewing axes--- the view on a plane is orthogonal if an axis line is reduced to appear as a point in the centroid of the tetrahedron. The view axes of the four triad identities map to the four medians (axes of 3-fold symmetry) of the tetrahedron, depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:depviewaxes} with cyan colored lines. Independent dyad planes are revealed when the viewing angle is such that the midpoints of opposite tetrahedral edges are aligned. There are three pairs of opposite edges (LP, TC, AD), and therefore three viewing angles of this kind, which map to the bimedians of the tetrahedron (axes of 2-fold symmetry), depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:indepviewaxes} with magenta lines.

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
    \centering
    \input{ASY/DepViewAxes.tex}
    \caption{The four view axes of the triad dependencies map to the medians of the tetrahedron. Rotate the tetrahedron so that a given cyan line is reduced to a point: The resulting view is then orthogonal to the outermost identity when flattened to 2d.}
    \label{fig:depviewaxes}
\end{subfigure}
~~
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
    \input{ASY/IndepViewAxes.tex}
    \caption{The three view axes of the independent planes map to the bimedians of the tetrahedron. Rotate the tetrahedron so that a given magenta line is reduced to a point: The resulting view is then orthogonal to independent plane defined on the basis of the two perpendicular edges crossing in the middle of the figure.}
    \label{fig:indepviewaxes}       
\end{subfigure}
\caption{The seven principal view axes of the demographic time identity. Figures are interactive if viewed in a recent version of Adobe Reader. Click each figure to activate. A mouse wheel (or right click and drag) can be used to zoom. Left click and drag to rotate.}
\label{fig:viewaxes}
\end{figure}

Given a 3d volume of data structured by the demographic time identity, a cross-section orthogonal to a magenta line from Fig.~\ref{fig:indepviewaxes} is an independent plane. There is no reason not to do this for outcome measures, for example disease prevalence, in search of meaningful patterns. Further, when \emph{slicing} through such a complex timespace, we are agnostic about cut angles in general, but \emph{snapping} to axes defined on the basis of unit time measures leads to easier interpretation.
